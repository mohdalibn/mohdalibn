An experienced Self-taught Programmer. I am currently working towards my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Memorial University of Newfoundland in NL, Canada. 
I am enthusiastic about developments in the fields of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, & Web Development. I've worked on applicable personal ML, Computer Vision, & Web Development projects and learned new industry-demanding skills. I get excited about opportunities where I can leverage my Machine Learning and Data Science Skills to work on challenging projects.
